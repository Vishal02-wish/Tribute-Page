				About the Legend
			</h1>
			<p>
				&#9733; Pichai was born in Madurai, Tamil Nadu, India, to a Tamil Brahmin family. His
				mother, Lakshmi, was a stenographer, and his father, Regunatha Pichai, was an electrical engineer at
				GEC, the British conglomerate.<br><br>
				&#9733; Pichai completed schooling in Jawahar Vidyalaya Senior Secondary School in Ashok Nagar, Chennai
				and completed the Class XII from Vana Vani school at IIT Madras. He earned his degree from IIT
				Kharagpur in metallurgical engineering and is a distinguished alumnus from that institution. He
				holds an M.S. from Stanford University in materials science and engineering, and an MBA from the Wharton
				School of the University of Pennsylvania, where he was named a Siebel Scholar and a Palmer Scholar,
				respectively.<br><br>
				&#9733; Pichai worked in engineering and product management at Applied Materials and in management
				consulting
				at McKinsey & Company. Pichai joined Google in 2004, where he led the product management and
				innovation efforts for a suite of Google's client software products, including Google Chrome and
				ChromeOS, as well as being largely responsible for Google Drive. He went on to oversee the development
				of other applications such as Gmail and Google Maps.<br><br>
				&#9733; On November 19, 2009, Pichai gave a demonstration of ChromeOS; the Chromebook was released for
				trial
				and testing in 2011, and released to the public in 2012. On May 20, 2010, he announced the
				open-sourcing of the new video codec VP8 by Google and introduced the new video format, WebM.
				<br><br> &#9733; On March 13, 2013, Pichai added Android to the list of Google products that he oversaw.
				Android was formerly managed by Andy Rubin, who was a director of Jive Software from April 2011 to
				July 30, 2013.
				<br><br> &#9733; Pichai was selected to become the next CEO of Google on August 10, 2015, after
				previously
				being appointed Product Chief by CEO, Larry Page. On October 24, 2015, he stepped into the new position
				at the completion of the formation of Alphabet Inc., the new holding company for the Google company
				family.
				<br><br> &#9733; Pichai had been suggested as a contender for Microsoft's CEO in 2014, a position that
				was
				eventually given to Satya Nadella. In August 2017, Pichai drew publicity for firing a Google
				employee who wrote a ten-page manifesto criticizing the company's diversity
				policies.
				<br><br> &#9733; In December 2017, Pichai was a speaker at the World Internet Conference in China, where
				he
				stated that "a lot of work Google does is to help Chinese companies. There are many small and
				medium-sized businesses in China who take advantage of Google to get their products to many other
				countries outside of China.
				<br><br> &#9733; On December 11, 2018, Sundar Pichai was questioned by the United States House Judiciary
				Committee on a range of Google-related issues such as possible political bias on Google's platforms, the
				company's alleged plans for a "censored search app" in China, and its privacy practices. In
				response, Pichai told the committee that Google employees cannot influence search results. He also
				stated that Google users can opt out of having their data collected and that "there are no current plans
				for a censored search engine" in China.
				<br><br> &#9733; In 2022, Pichai received the <strong>Padma Bhushan </strong>in the category of Trade
				and
				Industry from the
				Government of India, the country's third-highest civilian award.
				<br><br> &#9733; Pichai is married to Anjali Pichai and has two children. Anjali is
				originally from Kota, India. They became close while studying together at IIT, Kharagpur. His
				recreational interests include cricket and football. He lives in Los Altos Hills,
				California.
